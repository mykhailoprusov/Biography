# Biography


### Technical Skills:
- 	Python, Java, HTML and CSS
-	Familiarity with C and Haskell
-	Django framework
-	PostgreSQL and MySQL
-	Linux and Windows
-	GitHub and GitLab
-	Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

### Projects:
-	Developed a sport nutrition web application using Python and Django that allowed users to receive sport meals suggestions from ChatGPT api, view diet articles and interact with other people through the blog. The project garnered significant recognition and was showcased on Beetroot Academy's official website as one of the standout achievements. You can find my video presentation, which was instrumental in attracting new students, by following this link: https://beetroot.academy/courses/online/python
-	Achieved 350 accomplished tasks on codewars.com (https://www.codewars.com/users/NeverGoingBack)
-	Built a weather website with Django that shows current weather for 1 or 2 chosen cities and a 5-day forecast. In addition, it utilizes asyncio library to make 2 asynchronous requests for 2 different cities and consequently compare them in a real time
-	Developed a live face recognition application that utilises cv2 and deepface libraries to match the person in front of the camera with the picture and show age and sex of that user
-	Placed into the Agile team of 5 during Advanced Programming module where we were supposed to create a classic Bulls & Cows game using Java programming language. The terminal game allows to create account,log in as a user o guest or quit.  Later, there are options to play the game,view the leaderboard or view the stats. It is also possible for the user to save the game and load it again when returning back to the game. Along this coursework we used gitlab resource to the max including an issue board which we utilized to take the tasks. 
-	As a part of our Computer Systems & Architecture module, I was paired with 4 other students in a team and tasked to create a Shell in C programming language. The shell prompts the user for input, reads and parses user input correctly, executes external commands, sets it's home directory, gets the current path when asked and restores it's home path on exiting, changes directories, adds the past 20 commands to an external history file and gets a command from the file and executes it, keeps a persistent history of commands, set ups, invokes, removes and prints aliases and keeps persistent aliases.
